# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a comprehensive web-based tool designed to visualize and analyze various sorting algorithms. The visualizer aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms through interactive, real-time graphical representations. It is particularly useful for students, educators, and professionals seeking to explore algorithmic behavior in an intuitive manner.

## Project Overview

### Key Features

- **Algorithm Visualization:**
  - Includes popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
  - Provides an interactive experience by dynamically updating the visual representation of the sorting process.

- **User Interactivity:**
  - **Array Generation:** Generate a new array with randomized values at the click of a button, enabling repeated testing and learning.
  - **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from multiple sorting algorithms via a user-friendly dropdown menu.
  - **Speed Control:** Fine-tune the visualization speed with a responsive slider, allowing users to observe the algorithmâ€™s performance at different paces.
  - **Algorithm Analysis:** Displays the time complexity for each algorithm (Best, Average, and Worst cases) alongside a C++ code snippet for better understanding.

- **Responsive and Modern UI:**
  - Designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring usability across various devices and screen sizes.
  - A clean and modern interface with intuitive controls enhances the learning experience.

### Technical Analysis

#### Sorting Algorithms Implemented
- **Bubble Sort:** A simple but inefficient algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Despite its O(n^2) time complexity in average and worst cases, it is useful for educational purposes due to its simplicity.

- **Selection Sort:** This algorithm sorts by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion and putting it at the beginning. It has a consistent O(n^2) time complexity, making it less efficient for larger datasets.

- **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted array one element at a time, making it efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets. It operates with an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), but can be as fast as O(n) in the best case.

- **Merge Sort:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm that consistently sorts with O(n log n) time complexity. It is stable and efficient for larger datasets, although it requires additional space for merging.

- **Quick Sort:** Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that, on average, sorts in O(n log n) time. However, its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2). It is typically faster than Merge Sort due to lower constant factors but can be unstable depending on the implementation.

### Visualization and Analysis
This tool not only visualizes the sorting process but also provides analytical insights by displaying key performance metrics. Users can observe how each algorithm manipulates data in real-time, offering a practical demonstration of theoretical concepts.
